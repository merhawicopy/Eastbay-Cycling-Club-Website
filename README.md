# Question 1
## (a)

Speed, reliability, and security are the three reasons I would prefer to use a static site over a web app.

## (b)

Brunch:

An ultra-fast HTML5 build tool. Capable of static site generation using whatever templating engine you choose.
Can use any Javascript template engine.

It is similar with Metalsmith static site generator because Brunch can use any Javascript template engine.
It is based on Javascipt and general type site generator.


## (c)

Surge

Surge offers free service for publishing any folder with custom domain, basic ssl, and unlimited publishing, but charges
$30 per month for unlimited production-ready projects with custom domain, custom ssl, force http to https, unlimited
projects, unlimited publishing, password protection, custom redirects, and cross-origin resource sharing.

my IPv4 address('10.0.0.18') doesn't fall into any of the special use address categories.

## (c)

[ '151.101.196.223' ]

# Question 3
## (a)

Ethernet is a network that allows computers in a local area to connect to each other.
The computers connected over the Ethernet are usually within the same building or within close proximity of each other.
Since the computers use meters of cable to connect to each other, it is impractical to connect computers very far away from each other.
IP, on the other hand, lets us to connect to computers far away in order to access information.

## (b)

Using TCP I can solve this problem since TCP provides a reliable delivery of byte streams.
The Transport Layer should have this functionality

## (c)

TCP and UDP both provide multiplexing via source and destination port numbers.
But, TCP also provides for reliable delivery of byte streams. This greatly increases its complexity over UDP.

We use TCP to carry web traffic because TCP is absolutely packed with functions that make sure that traffic will arrive in the correct order, that no packets 
are lost, that any lost packets are automatically sent again.


# Question 4
## (a)

We need both a source and destination ports because TCP has to know where the request is coming from
and where it is going. For example, if you had 4 webpages open, all sending and receiving on port 80, 
it would not know where the response traffic is meant to be directed. This is why the source port and destination port are used.
