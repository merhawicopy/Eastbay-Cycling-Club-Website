### The East Bay Cycling Club (EBCC) was founded in 2001 to fill a gap in the East Bay cycling community. 

### Our goal is to bring cyclists together to ride, race, share advice and talk about sunglasses over a post-ride espresso or beer. 

### If this sounds good to you, join us on our rides and think about becoming a member.
***
#### We are located in Hayward California.
#### We are open from Monday to Sunday from 8am to 8pm.
#### Call us &#x00040; &#x0002A; 408 000 0001 &#x0002A;
